There are 3 units including Yang District Administrative Service Bureau, Chaoyang District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, Beijing Economic and Information Bureau. 1. Existing problems or bottlenecks

In the application of North Korea&#39;s theme service matters, it involves business entity identity authentication and materials Collect two important links. When the government service center conducts business to the masses, it needs

Access to the data of enterprises or individual industrial and commercial households of the Municipal Supervision Bureau, and the documents collected by the front-end system Connect to the back-end archive system.

1. The process of corporate identity authentication is cumbersome, and authentication is not authoritative. Because there is no To get through the data, the service people need to manually submit a lot of information when handling online, service experience Poor; staff can only check the enterprise information through manual search, efficiency

Low and there are security risks.

1. The front-end system and back-end filing system for the collection of subject matter materials are two systems,

This caused manual entry during archiving.

1. Chaoyang District combines the &quot;Notification Commitment Approval System&quot; vigorously promoted by Beijing In the easy-to-do business, but the &quot;information commitment&quot; is only retained in paper, and there are a lot of follow-up Management of paper materials.

The account is the actual initiator and related party of the blockchain transaction, recorded in the block Account data All transaction information is linked to related accounts. Every blockchain service

Business customers must have one or more accounts to use blockchain services.

In the design of blockchain technology, a block refers to what happens within a given time Transaction processing will be organized into data structures. Normally, the block consists of Block header and block body. The block header contains control information related to the block, The block body contains specific transaction data.

Transaction refers to the specific business actions carried on the blockchain system. The transaction includes both

Transaction data

And digital asset transaction type transactions, including other non-transaction type transactions.

Entities are some specific attributes of the transaction, including the initiator address and receiver Address, storage data and physical data remarks.

Contracts, also known as smart contracts, are a set of contracts defined in the form of computer code

Promise, and the contract participants can execute the promised agreement, that is: using a computer

Contract data Write conditional agreement reached by contract participants in code form

When triggered, the blockchain system automatically executes the protocol. According to the application scenario With the same demand, the blockchain system can selectively provide smart contract functions.
